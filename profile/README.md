# VA Big Data Genomics Group

The VA Big Data Genomics group is a collaboration between the Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine (SCGPM), Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research (PAVIR), and Department of Veterans Affairs. Our group uses cloud technologies to identify and implement effective practices for managing, characterizing, and analyzing large genomic datasets. We are currently focussed on variant calling, aggregation, quality control, and distribution of 100,000+ genomes sequenced as part of the VA [Million Veteran Program](https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/).
